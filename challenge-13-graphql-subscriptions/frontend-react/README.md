# Challenge 13: GraphQL API with Subscriptions - Frontend

## Overview
This is the frontend React application for Challenge 13, which demonstrates GraphQL API integration with real-time subscriptions.

## Features
- GraphQL query and mutation examples
- Real-time subscription implementation
- Apollo Client integration
- Responsive design

## Technologies Used
- React 18
- Vite for fast development
- Apollo Client for GraphQL
- GraphQL WebSocket link for subscriptions

## Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend-react`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

# Challenge 47: Test Coverage Analysis

## Description
This challenge focuses on implementing code coverage measurement using Xdebug. You'll learn to analyze which parts of your code are executed during testing.

## Learning Objectives
- Implement code coverage analysis tools
- Use Xdebug for coverage data collection
- Analyze code execution paths
- Generate coverage reports
- Identify untested code areas
- Understand coverage metrics

## Requirements
- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- Xdebug extension
- Understanding of code coverage concepts

## Features to Implement
1. Coverage Collector
   - Xdebug integration
   - Execution tracing
   - Data collection
   - Memory management
   - Performance optimization

2. Analysis Engine
   - Line coverage calculation
   - Branch coverage analysis
   - Path coverage tracking
   - Complexity metrics
   - Dead code detection

3. Reporting System
   - HTML reports
   - XML reports
   - Text summaries
   - Visualization tools
   - Trend analysis

4. Advanced Features
   - Coverage thresholds
   - Differential coverage
   - Integration with CI/CD
   - Coverage badges
   - Historical tracking

## Setup Instructions
1. Navigate to the `backend-php` directory
2. Run `composer install` to install dependencies
3. Install and enable Xdebug extension
4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your settings
5. Start the development server with `php server.php`
6. Navigate to the `frontend-react` directory
7. Run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies
8. Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server

## API Endpoints
- `POST /api/coverage/start` - Start coverage collection
- `POST /api/coverage/stop` - Stop coverage collection
- `GET /api/coverage/report` - Generate coverage report
- `GET /api/coverage/metrics` - Get coverage metrics
- `POST /api/coverage/analyze` - Analyze code coverage
- `GET /api/coverage/history` - Get coverage history

## Evaluation Criteria
- Proper implementation of coverage collection mechanisms
- Effective Xdebug integration
- Accurate coverage analysis
- Comprehensive reporting features
- Clean visualization tools
- Comprehensive test coverage

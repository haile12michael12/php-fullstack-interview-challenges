### Already Comprehensive README Files
The following challenges already had comprehensive README files and required no changes:
- challenge-15-advanced-error-handling
- challenge-18-generators-iterators
- challenge-25-fluent-interface
- challenge-58-dependency-injection-container
(And many others with detailed documentation)

## README Template Structure

All enhanced and new README files follow a consistent structure:

1. **Challenge Title and Description**
2. **Learning Objectives**
3. **Requirements**
4. **Features to Implement**
5. **Project Structure**
6. **Setup Instructions**
7. **API Endpoints** (where applicable)
8. **Evaluation Criteria**
9. **Resources**

This standardization ensures consistency across all challenges and makes it easier for developers to understand and implement each challenge.

## Technologies Covered

The enhanced README files cover a wide range of modern PHP development topics:
- gRPC communication
- REST and GraphQL APIs
- Authentication and authorization
- Microservices architecture
- Caching strategies
- File handling and security
- Image processing
- Real-time communication (WebSockets, GraphQL subscriptions, long polling)
- Error handling and logging
- Docker and containerization
- Contract testing
- And many more advanced topics

Each README provides clear instructions for setup, implementation guidance, and links to relevant resources for further learning.

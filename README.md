## Getting Started

Each challenge is contained in its own directory with a consistent structure:

```
challenge-XX-challenge-name/
├── backend-php/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── composer.json
│   └── Dockerfile
├── frontend-react/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json

├── docker-compose.yml
└── README.md
```

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+
- Composer
- Node.js 16+
- Docker (recommended)
- Git

### Running a Challenge

1. Navigate to any challenge directory
2. For backend setup:
   ```bash
   cd backend-php
   composer install
   ```
3. For frontend setup:
   ```bash
   cd frontend-react
   npm install
   ```
4. Using Docker (recommended):
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

## Challenge Structure

Each challenge includes:

1. **Detailed README**: Learning objectives, requirements, and implementation details
2. **Backend Implementation**: PHP code following modern practices
3. **Frontend Interface**: React application for interaction
4. **Docker Configuration**: Containerized development environment
5. **Testing Framework**: Unit and integration tests

## Progression Path

The challenges are designed to be completed in order, with each building on concepts from previous challenges:

- **Challenges 15-26**: Foundation skills
- **Challenges 27-44**: Data and security focus
- **Challenges 45-56**: Quality and performance
